# hello-world

Hello everyone!

Even though I know that it's highly unlikely that anybody is going to view this, I thought that it would be a good idea to start writing a little bit about myself. I don't know if anybody likes Super Mario as much as I do, although I don't play a lot of games a lot of the time (I'm usually just listening to songs in Spanish and talking with my Spanish friends). I would like to become a manager one day and, to become that, probably I should start with understanding a bit of code. One more line? OK. In the future I would like to be able to speak Spanish with the ones I love most.
